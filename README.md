##Data Analytics  :

1. PFA the visualization assignment on which you have to work. 
2. PFA the DSA assignment.
3.  A programming question based on python.
  
 	BinaryStringsSet : Program that takes two arguments n and k and prints all binary strings of length n that contain k zero bits, one per line. The program:
         Must be called binary.py
         Must provide a function called bits(n, k) that returns a set of strings
         Must contain adequate comments and documentation
         Without using any libraries of python like iterables.

Run the unit tests to ensure that the program is correct.

##Software Development  :

Use Node.js Framework 
Database: MongoDB

Web application which uses railway's api (https://railwayapi.com/api/#seat-availability) to get seat availability status.
Input Fields : Train number , From station , To station , date , class , quota
